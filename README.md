# Number-Plate-Detection
The code for the project is written in MATLAB by using concept of Image Processing to get the vehicle number plate into text format. 
Intially templates are created for all alphabets, numbers and saved in memory.
Then from the input image we try to read characters and find the highest matched character from the template.  
We use the commands of Image Processing to read characters from the captured image.
